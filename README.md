## Landing page

This project for the Nothing brand uses the following technologies:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for structuring and styling the page.
1. Flexbox and Grid layouts are used for element positioning on the page.
1. Styles are written using SCSS to improve code organization and maintainability.
1. Animations and transformations are implemented to enhance user interaction.
1. The BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology ensures a structured and maintainable CSS class system.
1. The page is responsive and automatically adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
